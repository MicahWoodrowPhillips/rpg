rising power on the shores of Lake Encarthan, Molthune (pronounced mole-THOON)[1] desperately wants to be a nation\/empire whose power rivals those of great nations of the Inner Sea. At the moment it is a nation whose ambition outstrips it abilities, but with new incentives encouraging immigration and enlistment in the national army, this may not be the case for long.\n\n\nGovernment\nMolthune is ruled over by an Imperial Governor who has, ever since the country achieved independence, been selected from the Molthune army. Below the imperial governor are nine General Lords who each tend to certain areas of the country. These generals are in charge of deciding on the new Imperial governor, normally when the previous one dies as it is a position held for life. The absolute rule of the military may not be popular with some but, despite what their critics say, each General Lord is an efficient statesman, and they are far better suited to running the ongoing hostilities with Nirmathas and managing the territorial ambitions of Molthune than civilian governors would be\n\nHistory\nThe history of Molthune as a free nation, like many others, begins with the death of Aroden and the subsequent decline of the Chelaxian empire. Before Molthune achieved independence in 4632 AR, it was merely a distant province to differing empires, first the empire of Taldor, then Cheliax. When the various factions within Cheliax began to splinter, Molthune was quick to take advantage and declared itself independent, later inspiring Andoran and Galt to follow Molthune's example. Unfortunately, shortly after they seceded from Cheliax they suffered a similar fate. The rebellious folk who dwelt in and around the Fangwood Forest in north Molthune had long chaffed under the repressive rule of Cheliax and longed for freedom.  They rejoiced when Molthune turned its back on its oppressors but within a few short years they realised that this succession had changed nothing except where they sent their tithes. So in 4648 AR, the people of northern Molthune (as it was at the time) began their violent rebellion. Within 7 short years the rebels had won and the nation of Nirmathas was born.\n\nThe founding of Nirmathas was not the end to hostilities between these two nations, it just heralded a new direction for the conflict. Ever since Nirmathas' founding, Molthune has been trying desperately to get it back. The most recent imperial governor, Markwin Teldas, has instrumented many new policies with the suspected aim of an invasion of Molthune's northerly neighbor, Nirmathas.\n\nGeography\nMolthune lies in central Avistan on the shores of Lake Encarthan nestled between some of the most powerful nations on the continent. In some respects this is an ideal location for an aspiring superpower - in others, it is not. To its east, Molthune is bordered by Druma, an unassailable merchant nation that is too valuable a trading partner to invade. To the south and west seperated by the Menador Mountains lie Cheliax and Nidal respectively, an unholy alliance of shadow touched priests and Hell-spawned fiends. Neither country is viable for Molthune's territorial ambitions as Cheliax, despite the loss of much of its empire, is still one of the most powerful nations of the inner sea and Nidal is one of its closest allies. To the north lies Nirmathas which is the focus of Molthune's imperialist aggression.","__txt_char_contacts":"Shere Khan the Tiger\nBase stats\nHD: 3d8  (16)\nBAB 2\n\nFort  3  (4)\nRef   3  (7)\nWill  1  (3)\n\nStr 13,  Int 2, \nDex 17,  Wis 15, \nCon 13, Cha 10\n\nSize Medium; \nSpeed 40 ft.; \nAC +1 natural armor  (17)\n\n1x +3 bite 1d6+1;   (+4 and 1d6+2 with Bull focus)\n2x +1 claws 1d4;    (+2 and 1d4+1 with Bull focus)\n\n\nSpecial Attacks: Rake (1d4); \nSpecial Qualities: low-light vision, scent (Track DCs are easier)\n\n7th-Level Advancement\nSize Large; AC +2 natural armor; Attack bite (1d8), 2 claws (1d6); Ability Scores Str +8, Dex \u20132, Con +4; Special Attacks grab, pounce, rake (1d6).\n\nEvasion, Link, Share spells\n\nSkills: 3\nAcrobatics: +8, Survival +3, Perception +6\n\nDefault foci: Bat (Darkvision), Falcon (+4 Perception) or Bull (+2 Str).\n\nTricks: 5 + 2\nAid, Attack, Defend, Detect, Hunt, Watch, Exclusive, ","__txt_char_description":"He goes by Helmut, and is a tall man with gray hair and gray eyes, a cold stare that says little to anyone who doesn't know him well and nothing to those who do.  He internalizes everything, and never wears the appropriate reactions on his face.  He is amiable enough, though his charm lies much more with animals than humans.  Calm of temperament, he is nonetheless a fierce combatant, using his special bond with the great tiger Shere Khan, and his own scythe, to dismember his enemies.  \n\n\nBorn to a poor family in a hamlet just outside of Molthune's tumultuous walls, Grendel Helmut Spitzkregr was raised by his widowed mother as his father died when he was a babe.  Living at the edge of a forest, Helmut would venture far into its depths, learning to speak easier as a predator than as a contributing member of society.  Nonetheless, the furs he brought back helped keep the tax collectors at bay while his mother did teach him the Common tongue, along with their native Chellaxian, reading the stars, herbal remedies, and some small gardening.  \n\nOne day while he was out, Helmut came back to the cottage to find his mother intertwined with one of the village guards in a very primal way.  The argument that ensued brought tempers to their brink, bringing Helmut to shout, \"I wish you weren't even my mother!\"  to which his mother shouted back, \"I'm not!\"\n\nThe shock of the truth killed their argument there, and the guard hurriedly gathered his clothes and took his leave.  Helmut's mother - or the woman that had been taking care of him as one, anyway, who's name was Gerta - told him that his mother was taken far away when he was young, along with his father.  They were taken by royal guards in the night, and Gerta took pity on the child they left behind and raised him since.\n\nFinding out that his mother and father were somewhere else and may both be alive was too much for Helmut to handle, and he immediately set out for this far off land, called Brevoy.  To make his way, he's hired out his skills with the woods and animals as guide, hunter, trapper, and scout.  He brings his childhood friend Shere Khan wherever he goes, though Shere Khan's temperament has shown him to be quite lonely of late.","__txt_char_personality":"Subdued, calm, and quiet are his normal descriptors.  In battle, he lets loose a bit more, and uses a scythe to literally mow down his enemies.","total_ranks":"22","Gear01":"Bedroll","Feat16":"Animal Companion (Tiger):  Shere Khan","Feat4":"3: Planar Focus","SpellsKnown0":"5","SpellsKnown1":"3","Spell01Cast":"0","Spell02Cast":"0","Spell03Cast":"0","Spell04Cast":"0","Spell05Cast":"0","Spell06Cast":"","Spell01":"Create Water","Spell02":"Detect Magic","Spell03":"Enhanced Diplomacy","Spell04":"Mending","Spell05":"Spark","Spell06":"","Spell08Cast":"1","Spell09Cast":"1","Spell10Cast":"1","Spell11Cast":"","Spell08":"Magic Fang","Spell09":"Summon Nature's Ally 1","Spell10":"Speak with Animals","SpellPerDay0":"5","SpellPerDay1":"4","Spell11":"","Feat17":"Animal Focus: Various Enhancements to things","Feat18":"Nature Training (Count as Druid And Ranger for stuff)","Featxtra0":"Orisons","Featxtra1":"Wild Empathy (Cha+Level+d20)","Featxtra2":"Precise Companion (Outflank)","Featxtra3":"Track (+1\/2 Level to Survival)","Featxtra4":"Hunter Tactics  (Share Teamwork Feats) (L3)","Featxtra5":"Bonus Teamwork Feats: 1 (L3)","Feat5":"3H: Pack Flanking (Always flanking with Animal C)","PicURL":"https:\/\/s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com\/736x\/72\/06\/a2\/7206a268b7cc3029c9246fd4a754f02a.jpg","Weapon2":"Comp.
