Train-only messing around with things like game stuff, various Spring tech (WebFlux, SpringConfig, Boot, WebMVC, etc.)

This is called rpg because it's possible this will turn into some kind of role-playing game, but it doesn't have to.  When bored, adding model objects, interfaces, and factories to be used by the more interesting stuff later.

Wants:
 * Some kind of roadmap.  It's always good to have goals.
 * A clear code style.  Stole current one from some minimalist enterprise thing, but it might be better to check in a proper file.
 * A spot to host live code.  Figure this out eventually.
